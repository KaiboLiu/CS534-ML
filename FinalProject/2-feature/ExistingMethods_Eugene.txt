[Challenges]
- One of the challenges of speech recognition is the wide range of variability in speech and acoustics. [1]

[How to recognize (features)]
- recognize words [1]
- tonal features: Chinese language is a tonal language.  Tone classification plays an important role in Chinese speech recognition [2, 3]
- All utterances were sampled at 8 kHz with 16-bit resolution. The feature vector consisted of 12-order LPC-derived cepstral coefficients, 12-order delta cepstral coefficients, one delta log energy and one delta delta log energy referred to [4, 5]
- Chinese is a tone language:  http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/langdiff/chinese.htm
  : English has more vowel sounds than Chinese.
  : Chinese learners find it difficult to hear the difference between l and r, and so may mispronounce rake and rice as lake and lice. Southern Chinese speakers have a similiar difficulty in distinguishing l and n.
- Vectors of speech signal features (e.g., mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), linear prediction coefficients (LPC), perceptual linear prediction coefficients (PLP), bottleneck features (ML), etc.) are extracted from the acoustical signal for dimensionality reduction and probabilistic modeling. [7]

[Models]
- Hidden Markov models
- feed-forward neural network
- recurrent neural networks (LSTMs)
- convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- deep neural network (DNNs)
