##### supplement for dataset
1. voice record could have diff frequence, so maybe need to check data from different dataset.
2. voice example could have different length in diff level (how complicated), and it may influence model running time.
3. http://www.voxforge.org/home/listen , normalized dataset, but no Chinese.

**feature: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
           delta-features (1st/2nd derivative of mel-freq ceptral coeff).

**method: SVM, Gaussian Mixture Model, Neural Network

2.A Review of Audio Features and Statistical Models Exploited for Voice Pattern Design  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06811v1.pdf
**preprocessing: audio signal digitalized
				re-sample, bandpass filter, amplitude normalization
				segment signal to overlapped time frames
				linear transformation (FFT, DCT, Wavelet) applied to each frame to extract feature vectors.
**feature: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, 
	       1st and 2nd derivation of feature vectors, 
		   time localized frequency peak, 
		   time-frequency energy peak location.
**postProcessing: feature normalization ~ N(0, 1).
**method/model: Gaussian Mixture Model, Hidden Markov Model, 
	            Non-negative Matrix Factorization (to decrase data dimension, which means to reduce the local statistical redundancy of the feature vectors)
